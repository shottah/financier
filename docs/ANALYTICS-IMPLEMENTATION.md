# Analytics Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The analytics dashboard has been updated to display real transaction data from processed bank statements instead of mock data.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoints

- **Created `/api/statements`**: New endpoint to fetch all statements with transactions
- **Updated `/api/cards`**: Added `includeStatements` query parameter to optionally include statement and transaction data
- **Updated `/api/statements/[id]`**: Added GET method to fetch individual statements with transactions

### 2. Analytics Page (`/analytics`)

The analytics page now:
- Fetches real data from the database
- Displays actual transaction information
- Calculates metrics based on processed statements
- Shows category breakdowns based on transaction descriptions
- Lists top merchants by spending
- Displays recent transactions with card associations

### 3. Data Processing

The page processes transaction data to show:
- **Total Spending**: Sum of all debit transactions
- **Total Income**: Sum of all credit transactions
- **Net Cash Flow**: Income minus spending
- **Transaction Count**: Total number of transactions
- **Monthly Trends**: Income vs spending by month
- **Category Analysis**: Automatic categorization based on merchant names
- **Top Merchants**: Most frequent spending destinations

### 4. Category Classification

Transactions are automatically categorized into:
- Food & Dining
- Shopping
- Transportation
- Entertainment
- Utilities
- Transfers
- Banking & Fees
- Travel
- Insurance
- Healthcare
- Fitness & Sports
- Other

### 5. Features

- **Card Filtering**: View analytics for all cards or individual cards
- **Tab Navigation**: Overview, Spending analysis, and Transaction history
- **Real-time Data**: Automatically updates when new statements are processed
- **Visual Representations**: Simple charts using CSS/Tailwind (ready for chart library integration)
